Phone Number and Email Verification: In this project, I used Python standard libraries to create a tool for verifying phone numbers and emails without sending actual messages. I then developed a Google Chrome extension and hosted it locally using Flask. The tool processes a CSV file containing numerous phone numbers and emails, verifying their validity and updating the file with this information. This tool can save companies time and resources by avoiding incorrect calls or emails.
